MPLS TP Security Features - control plane, management plane, data plane
1.Security needs to be provided for both data plane and control plane [2]. Transport Profile for MPLS (MPLS-TP) specific security considerations are discussed in [1], which, when applied with bidirectional forwarding detection as per [3], can be used to enhance the security of the control plane through verifying the operations, administration and maintenance channel. For example continuity check messages can be authenticated. It is recommended to use Secure hash algorithm 1 [3, p. 10, 4] with 20 byte authentication-key. This way third party devices cannot be installed in the MPLS-TP network without notice or attacks cannot be made through the management console. It also protects malfunctions as the result of an operational error. If the security strings of the continuity check messages do not match the path is regarded invalid and the network management system shows an alarm.
